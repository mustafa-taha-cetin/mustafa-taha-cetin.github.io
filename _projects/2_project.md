## Performance Comparison of AI Chatbots (October 2025)

A comprehensive research project comparing the performance of three major AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

### Project Background

During my internship at BeneluxSoft B.V., I conducted an in-depth analysis of leading AI chatbot models to evaluate their performance across multiple dimensions.

### Research Methodology

**Testing Framework**:
- Created automated testing scripts in Python
- Developed standardized evaluation metrics
- Analyzed response quality, accuracy, and speed
- Generated visualization reports using Matplotlib

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Response accuracy and relevance
- Processing speed and latency
- Contextual understanding
- Handling of complex queries
- Error rates and edge cases

### Key Findings

The research revealed significant differences in:
- **Reasoning capabilities**: Each model showed distinct strengths
- **Response speed**: Varied based on query complexity
- **Context retention**: Different approaches to conversation memory
- **Specialized tasks**: Performance varied by domain

### Technical Implementation

**Tools & Technologies**:
- Python for automation and data processing
- Google ADK for agent testing
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Statistical analysis libraries

**Data Collection**:
- 500+ test queries across multiple categories
- Automated response logging and analysis
- Performance metrics tracking
- Comparative benchmarking

### Publication

This research was published with DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.17249242](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17249242)

### Impact

The findings provide valuable insights for:
- AI model selection for specific use cases
- Understanding LLM capabilities and limitations
- Guiding future AI integration decisions
