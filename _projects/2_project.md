### Research Overview

This research evaluates and compares three leading large language models (LLMs) to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and optimal use cases. The study was conducted during my internship at BeneluxSoft B.V.

**Published at**: [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17249242](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17249242)

### Key Findings

The research revealed that **Claude achieved the highest overall score (8.7/10)**, followed by ChatGPT (8.3/10) and Gemini (7.7/10) across four primary evaluation criteria:

| Model | Speed | Accuracy | Clarity | Helpfulness | **Overall** |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Claude | 8.5 | 9.0 | 9.0 | 8.5 | **8.7** |
| ChatGPT | 8.0 | 8.5 | 8.5 | 8.0 | **8.3** |
| Gemini | 7.5 | 8.0 | 7.5 | 7.5 | **7.7** |

### Evaluation Methodology

**Four Key Criteria**:

1. **Speed**: Response generation time and overall system responsiveness
2. **Accuracy**: Correctness of information and factual precision
3. **Clarity**: Communication effectiveness and explanation quality
4. **Helpfulness**: Practical utility and user satisfaction

**Testing Approach**:
- Standardized query sets across multiple domains
- Consistent evaluation rubrics
- Quantitative scoring system (0-10 scale)
- Qualitative analysis of response characteristics

### Technical Implementation

**Analysis Framework**:
- Python-based data collection and processing
- Automated scoring and visualization system
- Statistical analysis of performance metrics
- Data visualization using Matplotlib

**Tools & Technologies**:
- Python for automation and analysis
- Google ADK for agent testing frameworks
- Matplotlib for generating comparison charts
- Statistical libraries for data processing

**Open Source Code**: All Python analysis code used to generate figures and data is publicly available at [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mustafa-taha-cetin/Performance_Comparison_AI_Chatbots_Graphs) (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17273588)

### Research Insights

**Claude's Strengths**:
- Highest accuracy and clarity scores
- Strong contextual understanding
- Detailed and well-structured responses
- Excellent at complex reasoning tasks

**ChatGPT's Strengths**:
- Balanced performance across all metrics
- Consistent response quality
- Wide range of task handling
- Strong general-purpose capabilities

**Gemini's Characteristics**:
- Good foundational performance
- Room for improvement in clarity
- Solid accuracy baseline
- Emerging capabilities

### Future Research Directions

The research includes a comprehensive future work plan:

1. **Agentic AI System Development**: Building an autonomous agent using Google ADK
2. **Standardized Benchmarking**: Implementing established benchmarks like:
   - **AgentBench** (ICLR'24)
   - **WebArena** for realistic web environments
   - **RE-Bench** for R&D capabilities
   - **τ-bench** for tool-agent-user interaction

3. **Extended Evaluation**: Testing across more diverse and complex scenarios
